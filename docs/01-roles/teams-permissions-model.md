# Teams roles and permissions

This document defines role behavior for team invites and membership administration.

## Roles

- `owner`: full control; can transfer ownership, manage billing, and remove any non-owner member.
- `admin`: can invite/manage members and operational modules, cannot remove last owner.
- `member`: standard day-to-day access for invoices, quotations, and customers.
- `viewer`: read-only access to selected modules.

## Permission matrix

| Capability | owner | admin | member | viewer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create invite | yes | yes | no | no |
| Revoke invite | yes | yes | no | no |
| Resend invite | yes | yes | no | no |
| Change member role | yes | yes (up to member/viewer) | no | no |
| Remove member | yes | yes (not owner) | no | no |
| Remove owner | yes (with replacement) | no | no | no |
| Access settings/team tab | yes | yes | no | no |

## Guardrails

- Users can only assign roles at or below their own authority.
- `admin` cannot promote someone to `owner`.
- API must enforce authorization regardless of hidden UI controls.
- Last owner in an organization/business cannot be removed without ownership transfer.

## Invite acceptance policy

- Invite is bound to normalized email; acceptance requires exact email match.
- If signed in as different email, acceptance UI must show mismatch guidance.
- Existing active membership acceptance is idempotent and returns `success=true` without duplication.

## Audit requirements

Every role or membership mutation writes `membership_events` with:

- actor id
- target id
- previous role/status
- new role/status
- timestamp

This enables incident investigation and rollback support.
